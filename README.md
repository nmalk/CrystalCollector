## About
This application is a number guessing game where a player has to match her or his score to the given random number. 

## How it works

   * There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * The crystal number is hidden until the player clicks on it, and the score is updated with each click on the crystal.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score exceeds the random number.

   * The game restarts at the end regardles of whether the player wins or loses.

     * When the game restarts, a new random number is displayed. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. At the same time, the user's score (and score counter) will go back to zero.

   * The app also tracks and displays the number of wins and losses.
